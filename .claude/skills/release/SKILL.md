# release

Automate README-DEV.md → "Release a new version of this repository" → **step 4. Create a GitHub
release**. This runs *after* the version has been bumped (README steps 1–3, i.e.
`bump-my-version bump release --tag` created the `vX.Y.Z` tag and `bump minor` moved the tree to the
next `.dev0`). This skill does **not** bump the version — it is the natural follow-on to `/push`.

Push the release tag, create the GitHub release (which triggers PyPI publishing), watch the publish
workflow to green, and verify the released version is live. Work through the steps in order; stop and
report if a step can't be completed.

## 1. Preconditions & determine the release tag

Confirm the current branch is `main`:

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
```

If not on `main`, stop and ask the user before releasing.

Confirm a clean working tree — the version-bump commits should already be in place:

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

If there is **any** output, stop and report the uncommitted files. Do not commit on the user's behalf.

Determine the release tag = the latest `v*` release tag reachable from HEAD:

```bash
git describe --tags --abbrev=0 --match 'v*'
```

Sanity-check it looks like a released version (`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, **no** `.dev` suffix) and show it
to the user. If it carries a `.dev` suffix, the version wasn't bumped to a release — stop and tell the
user to run README steps 1–3 first.

Guard against re-releasing an existing release:

```bash
gh release view <tag>
```

If the release already exists, stop and report — nothing to do. If you're unsure the tag matches the
bump the user just made, confirm with them before proceeding.

## 2. Push branch and tags

```bash
git push origin HEAD --tags
```

If the push is rejected (e.g. remote is ahead), **stop and report**. Do not force-push on your own
initiative.

## 3. Create the GitHub release

```bash
gh release create <tag> --title <tag> --generate-notes
```

`--generate-notes` auto-builds the release notes from merged PRs/commits since the previous release.
Print the resulting release URL. Creating (publishing) the release is what triggers the PyPI publish
workflow.

## 4. Wait for the PyPI publish workflow

The published release triggers the **Publish to PyPI** workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`), which
builds the distributions and publishes to PyPI via Trusted Publishing. Find the run and watch it to
completion:

```bash
gh run list --workflow publish.yml --limit 5
gh run watch <run-id> --exit-status
```

- `gh run watch --exit-status` exits non-zero if the run fails.
- If it **succeeds**, continue to step 5.
- If it **fails**, inspect and diagnose:

```bash
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
```

Report the real cause clearly (build/`twine check` failure, OIDC/Trusted-Publisher misconfig, etc.). **Do
not retry blindly** — republishing the same version to PyPI will fail, so the fix usually involves the
user (e.g. correcting the publisher config), not re-running the job.

## 5. Verify the published version

A green publish workflow means PyPI *accepted* the upload, but the index/CDN needs a moment to expose it.
Verify in two phases — don't rely on `uvx --refresh` alone, which can silently resolve to the previous
version if the index hasn't caught up.

`<version>` = the tag without the leading `v` (tag `v1.8.0` → `1.8.0`).

### 5a. Confirm the version is available on the PyPI index

The version-specific JSON endpoint returns `200` only once that exact version is published. Poll it,
retrying a few times with a short sleep between attempts until it returns `200` (propagation typically
takes seconds to a couple of minutes):

```bash
curl -sf -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://pypi.org/pypi/anki-addons-dataset/<version>/json
```

If it never appears within a sensible window, report that the publish workflow was green but the version
isn't visible on PyPI yet, and stop.

### 5b. Pull it to this machine and verify end-to-end

Only after 5a returns `200`, run the README's check so the just-published package is actually fetched and
executed here:

```bash
uvx --refresh anki-addons-dataset info
```

`--refresh` bypasses uvx's cache so it fetches the newly published version. Confirm the version it prints
equals `<version>`.

## Done

Report the final state: the pushed tag, the release URL, the publish-workflow result, and the verified
`uvx` version — or the first step that failed and why.
